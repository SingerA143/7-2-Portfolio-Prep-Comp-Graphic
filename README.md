How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach designing software is looking through the requirements so that I can understand what I need to do and able to see what I'm gonna be creating design software. After reviewing it, I do what the requirements wants us to do and just being my best on it because it wasn't easy. The past weeks were very challenging mostly because of the EXE file and I just hope I do better next course and never be afraid to ask a question even if I do understand it.


How do I approach developing programs?
I approach develop a program by seeing on what I have to do in the assignment and know what it is talking about. If I did something incorrect in the assignment, I'll try to do it over again but I still don't get it, then I will ask the professor or the students on the discussion post to see if they can explain how to fix it and/or see if they're having the same issue that I'm having. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
